In sum, there is evidence for overactivity in limbic sites (such as the amygdala and NAC) and underactivity or dysfunction in cortical sites, including the left temporal and prefrontal lobes.

Oni mają gdzieś z tyłu głowy, że wszystko trzeba przemodlić, ofiarować Bogu, że przede wszystkim trzeba słuchać autorytetów, czyli papieży – z wyłączeniem rzecz jasna Franciszka. Do dziś to zresztą widać, teologia jest poniekąd narzędziem ucisku i walki. Z jednej strony stygmatyzuje się bowiem tych wszystkich, którzy nie podzielają katolickiego światopoglądu jako ludzi niemoralnych, zdeprawowanych i ulegających obcym wpływom, a z drugiej – mobilizuje się opinię społeczną do masowych akcji poparcia dla Kościoła. Nigdzie indziej na świecie nie występuje to na taką skalę. Poza tym tylko w Polsce udało się konserwatystom katolickim uzyskać tak wielki wpływ na politykę. Przypomina to trochę Hiszpanię Franco, Irlandię targaną konfliktem religijnym albo Chile Pinocheta – na szczęście te trzy przykłady są już historią. Żeby sprawa była jasna: ja nie odkrywam Ameryki, nie trzeba studiować Michela Focaulta czy Pierre’a Bourdieu, żeby zdać sobie sprawę z przemocowego charakteru dyskursu teologicznego. Miałem tego świadomość już w trakcie studiów, gdy większość moich wykładowców ustawiała się w opozycji do dyskursu Ratzingera i Wojtyły. Dzisiaj, przynajmniej w Polsce, proporcje są zdecydowanie odwrócone.",

Jeżeli go zestawimy z jakimiś nawiedzonymi egzorcystami, Rydzykiem czy takim Jankowskim, to jest on na swój sposób oryginalny. Wymienieni wcześniej, podobnie jak cały szereg innych twarzy polskiego Kościoła, to jednak ludzie słabo wykształceni, trudno ich nazwać intelektualistami. Stosujemy wobec nich taryfę ulgową czy nawet ignorujemy tych prymitywnych ludzi, których pluralizm i zmiany cywilizacyjne przerosły, którzy nie rozumieją tego, co się dzieje, i uciekają się do najłatwiejszej, biało-czarnej retoryki. Zgodnie z nią my jesteśmy wspaniali, a świat jest zły, więc trzeba go odrzucić, trzeba go przekląć, trzeba się przed nim zamknąć, wyizolować, bo w ten sposób się zbawimy. Na tym polega ta strategia, stosowana niestety, z dużym powodzeniem przez Tadeusza Rydzyka i wielu innych. Jędraszewski to człowiek innego pokroju intelektualnego. A płynie w tym samym nurcie. Mam wrażenie, że w jego przypadku doszło do jakiegoś traumatycznego załamania. Sam nie wiem, z czym ta trauma jest związana. Może chodzi o sprawę arcybiskupa Paetza, w której Jędraszewski pokazał się nam jako obrońca tego molestującego kleryków drapieżcy.",

W swojej najnowszej, wydanej w 2012 roku książce The Jewish Gospels. The Story of the Jewish Christ [Żydowskie Ewangelie. Historia żydowskiego Chrystusa] Boyarin pisze: „Jeśli jest coś, co chrześcijanie wiedzą o swojej religii, to to, że nie jest ona judaizmem. Jeśli jest coś, co żydzi wiedzą o swojej religii, to to, że nie jest ona chrześcijaństwem”. Tak ostra świadomość różnicy między tymi dwiema religiami jest wynikiem ogromnego wysiłku włożonego przez chrześcijan i żydów w wytyczanie granicy w pierwszych wiekach naszej ery. W tym dziele byli czynni przede wszystkim chrześcijańscy teologowie i rabini, a jak ich wysiłki wyglądały i dlaczego podkreślanie różnic było dla nich tak ważne, świetnie pokazuje cytowana książka, która jest zdecydowanie zbyt mało znana, podczas gdy powinna stać się lekturą obowiązkową zarówno dla chrześcijan, jak i żydów. Niestety teologowie obu wyznań wyraźnie się od ustaleń Boyarina dystansują. Trudno się zresztą dziwić. Burzą one zastane sposoby myślenia i zmuszają do rewizji stanowisk uznanych za niezmienne i fundamentalne dla tożsamości i żydowskiej, i chrześcijańskiej, a może nawet dla każdego, kto chce zrozumieć, co się dzieje z każdą religią od chwili, gdy zaczyna podlegać zgoła niereligijnym zabiegom.

Były kompromisowymi rozwiązaniami uwarunkowanych kulturowo i historycznie konfliktów, a zostały potraktowane jak wyznaczniki ortodoksyjności i przynależności do wspólnoty kościelnej. Dialog został zastąpiony dyktatem, a poszukiwanie odpowiedzi na egzystencjalne pytania przerodziło się w nakaz posłuszeństwa wobec autorytetu.

Jego łydki są cienkie, z kilkoma zadrapaniami i siniakami, jak to u kilkulatka, który latem bawi się na dworze z kolegami. Machają swobodnie w przód w tył, w przód, w tył. Nagle prostują się i podnoszą do kąta prostego od podłogi. Czyli to już. Louis powie potem, że trwało to króciutko: tylko pięć sekund, może dziesięć. Na razie cienkie nogi Louisa Knapaysweeta fruwają na wszystkie strony jak puste portki, które ktoś przypiął klamerkami do sznura na pranie w wietrzne, sobotnie przedpołudnie. Za to ręce Louisa, przypięte do poręczy, leżą unieruchomione. Zgromadzeni patrzą więc tylko na te poobijane chłopięce nogi, które wyprężone, w konwulsjach młócą powietrze w szkole Świętej Anny, prowadzonej przez księży oblatów i siostry szarytki.",

W 1984 roku na wyprawie pod K2 zrobił jej się czyrak na ręku, miała kłopoty z nogą i kuśtykała po bazie. Słaniała się, chora, od namiotu do namiotu. I jakby mi wtedy ktoś powiedział, że ta kobieta wejdzie za dwa lata na K2, tobym nie uwierzyła. To była dla mnie najbardziej motywująca sytuacja w życiu. Kiedy źle się czuję, myślę sobie, że skoro Wanda po takich przejściach dała radę wejść na K2, to ja też powinnam się wybrać na K2. Historia Wandy to z jednej strony opowieść o autodestrukcji, a z drugiej o tym, jak ciało może być nam posłuszne i jak nasza wola zmusza nas do realizacji celu.",

Wtedy to Kongregacja Nauki Wiary wydała dekret pozbawiający praw nauczania teologii jednego z najważniejszych teologów Soboru Watykańskiego II – Hansa Künga. Jego jedyną przewiną było opublikowanie kilka lat wcześniej krytycznej książki na temat nieomylności papieskiej. Paweł VI nie widział w tym problemu, dopiero Jan Paweł II poczuł się zagrożony na świeżo objętym urzędzie papieskim. Ten krok był brzemienny w skutki i stworzył prawdziwą przepaść między teologami próbującymi wdrożyć idee soborowe w codzienne życie Kościoła a coraz bardziej skostniałą biurokracją watykańską. Kryterium rekrutującym zarówno hierarchów, jak i wykładowców była zasada dobrze znana: „mierny, bierny, ale wierny”. I tak zostało do dziś. Pozostawiamy bez komentarza motywy, jakie kierowały decyzją polskiego papieża. Nie wykluczamy jednak, że pierwszy z głównych grzechów nie był bez wpływu. Dodamy tylko, że dla Hansa Künga ta kara obróciła się w błogosławieństwo. Zmarły 6 kwietnia 2021 roku szwajcarski teolog zapewne z góry spogląda na swoich prześladowców, nawet jeśli jeden z nich został już przez ten sam Kościół ogłoszony świętym.",

It is an autocratic regime. The second element is territory, the fatherland, love of country and so on. The third element is the Church. It is the element to put everything together. It is the cement, if you like. It does not matter whether this is the Church or this is the Communist Party. It doesn’t make much difference. If you look at the history of Russia, you always had these elements put together. Putin is very careful in bringing the three elements together. It is the only way to keep the country whole. If you take away one of the elements, it collapses.’",

Dzieci! – Powtarza to słowo kilka razy i przywołuje historię ośmiolatka, którego mama rozwiodła się z przemocowym mężem. Zainteresował się nimi ksiądz. Dał kobiecie pracę, a chłopca zaczął gwałcić. Syn nic nie mówił matce, bo się bał, że straci pracę, mieszkanie, że znowu nie będą mieli co jeść. Nigdy jej o tym nie powiedział, żeby nie psuć jej szczęścia z tego, że w końcu ma za co żyć. – Ja sobie nie mogę tego nawet wyobrazić, jak musiało mu być ciężko, całe życie udawać przed mamą. – Ksiądz Biernat przełyka łzy.",

Jej założycielem był Plinio Corrêa de Oliveira, właściciel ziemski i brazylijski polityk. Jego celem politycznym i religijnym było „przywrócenie porządku”. W praktyce jego organizacja zwalczała w Brazylii reformę rolną, w Argentynie wspierała wojskową juntę i zastraszała zbyt „liberalnych” księży, w Chile wspierała dyktaturę Pinocheta, zwalczając tych hierarchów kościelnych, którzy angażowali się w obronę praw człowieka – w tym głównego katolickiego krytyka dyktatora, kard. Raúla Henríqueza. Pisaliśmy o tym sporo, omawiając stosunek Jana Pawła II i Benedykta XVI do teologii wyzwolenia. Ale Suchanow pisze też o rosyjskich powiązaniach Ordo Iuris. A także o putinowskich oligarchach nawróconych na radykalne prawosławie i o wspieraniu skrajnej prawicy i ultrakonserwatywnych fanatyków na całym świecie przez rosyjskie służby. Przedstawia też związki patriarchatu moskiewskiego z polskimi biskupami katolickimi, co w świetle wojny rozpętanej przez Putina 24 lutego 2022 roku nabrało nowego znaczenia.",

Zaniechanie wymiaru kary przez trybunał kościelny ani nie przekreśla przestępstwa, ani nie zmazuje winy. Każde przestępstwo powinno być ukarane. Jeżeli więc w wypadku Księdza do wymiaru kary nie doszło, to ze względu na specjalne okoliczności, przewidziane przez Ustawodawcę kościelnego w kan.2223 par.3 n.2. Okolicznością specjalną, która skłoniła sędziów Trybunału Metropolitalnego w Krakowie do zaniechania kary, był wyrok trybunału państwowego, a więc ukarania Księdza przez władzę świecką.",

W latach 60. intensywnie ze sobą współpracowali. Gdy Saduś wpadł w tarapaty z powodu swojej skłonności, Wojtyła załatwił mu nową karierę w Austrii. Tam odzyskał pełne zaufanie Wojtyły. O tym świadczy parę faktów. Saduś miał nadzwyczajne dojście do papieża; bez problemów dostawał prywatne audiencje dla siebie i dla swoich gości, Wojtyła powierzał mu swoje pieniądze, a opinia Sadusia ważyła przy wyborze polskich kandydatów na austriackie parafie. Gdyby nie pełna rehabilitacja upadłego księdza, kardynał Wojtyła nigdy nie odwiedziłby jego austriackiej parafii. Saduś i Groër również dobrze się znali. Saduś regularnie uczestniczył w pielgrzymkach do niedalekiego Maria Roggendorf. Jest informacja, że przynajmniej raz był ze swoimi ministrantami w gimnazjum w Hollabrunn zarządzanym przez Groëra. Groër, już jako arcybiskup, zapłacił za budowlane plany Sadusia, a kiedy Saduś był ciężko chory, modlił się przy jego łożu śmierci. Bez odpowiedzi pozostaje pytanie, czy Saduś i Groër wiedzieli, że coś ich łączy poza kapłaństwem: pociąg do młodych chłopców.",

To switch teams, the following rules apply.

The team lead is asked about the transfer and then he/she discusses it with the team. It doesn’t necessarily happen immediately. It might take up to two months for the change to actually happen due to normal business activity, such as finding a replacement and/or organizing a handover. There are other opportunities to switch teams, especially when business priorities require it. This policy only covers the case where the engineer wants to switch to a new team.",

Similarly, black employees are often encouraged to attend recruiting events at historically black colleges and universities. Although such practices are well intentioned, they can backfire if they lead to an imbalanced burden on the team members involved. A study of 1,700 professionals conducted by the Level Playing Field Institute showed that “the behaviors which were most likely to prompt someone to quit were: (1) being asked to attend extra recruiting or community related events because of one’s race, gender, religion or sexual orientation.” Summarizing a survey on the subject, ModelViewCulture recently wrote that “Diversity in tech work is having a profound, negative impact on advocates’ happiness, mental and physical health and work–life balance, as well as their safety, relationships, careers and security.” Ensure your diversity and inclusion efforts are equally distributed across interested parties, and make participation purely voluntary rather than an obligation.",

Menzies postulowała, że bliskość cierpienia i śmierci porusza nieświadome pokłady lęków egzystencjalnych, a świadoma organizacja pracy miała stanowić tarczę obronną wobec nich. Przejdźmy do pierwszej placówki. Nazwijmy ją oddziałem. Spotkania społeczności w oddziale od dłuższego czasu przepełnione są uczuciem beznadziejności, bezruchu, wręcz nudy. Wielu pacjentów robi wszystko, aby znaleźć wymówkę i nie pojawić się na spotkaniu. Staje się to często podstawą narzekania przez personel na niezaangażowanych pacjentów, którzy zaniedbują i nie biorą odpowiedzialności za swoje leczenie. Ci z kolei wznoszą oczy do nieba, wzruszają ramionami lub inaczej niewerbalnie pokazują, co myślą o tym „truciu”. Długie okresy ciszy przerywane są sarkastycznymi uwagami jednej z osób z personelu, która wkrótce opuszcza oddział. Jej wypowiedzi przyjmowane są z wdzięcznością, jak wybawienie z dręczącej atmosfery. Przez chwilę wymieniane są złośliwe uwagi na pozornie niepowiązane tematy. Przedmiotem tych uwag często są żarty pacjentów dotyczące przewidywania katastrofy po odejściu dwu osób z personelu. Po czym wzmaga się narzekanie personelu na pacjentów. W podejściu grupowo-analitycznym patrzymy na każdą grupę, a więc także na organizacje czy społeczności, jak na wciąż zachodzący relacyjny i komunikacyjny proces. Nazywamy go matrycą grupową – wzorcem komunikacyjno-relacyjnym obserwowanym w każdej ludzkiej grupie. Można opisać przejawy owej matrycy na kilku poziomach, z których część jest nieświadoma. Skorzystajmy z tego narzędzia, aby zajrzeć głębiej, o czym rozmawiają, a o czym nie rozmawiają osoby opisane w przytoczonym przykładzie. To pierwszy krok do tego, aby pomóc zespołowi zrozumieć, gdzie i dlaczego komunikacja i myślenie zostały zatrzymane. W oddziale na spotkaniach społeczności widać, że nikt nie chce ze sobą rozmawiać, dorośli narzekają na młodzież, a młodzież okazuje lekceważenie wobec wypowiedzi dorosłych. Czasami czyjaś kąśliwa uwaga pociąga za sobą rozładowanie negatywnych emocji wszystkich. Mowa jest wtedy o odejściu dwu osób z zespołu, ale nikt nie podejmuje tego tematu. To jest poziom bieżący matrycy grupowej: obserwowane interakcje. Głębszy poziom interakcji nazywamy przeniesieniowym, odnosząc się do przeniesienia badanego w terapiach psychodynamicznych. Jeśli spojrzymy na relacje personelu i pacjentów w tych kategoriach, widzimy podporządkowanego nastolatka, który poprzez zachowanie okazuje negatywne emocje wobec groźnej figury przeniesienia.",

Zdarza się, że terapeuta reaguje na niepokój pacjenta własnym niepokojem, wynikającym z podobnych obszarów swojej osobowości i uruchamia obrony zgodne lub komplementarne do obron pacjenta poprzez proces nieświadomej identyfikacji.

To samobójcze zachowanie mrówek jest adaptacyjne z punktu widzenia pasożyta, który musi się dostać do układu pokarmowego przeżuwacza, aby móc się rozmnożyć. Dennett uważa, że religie trwają, ponieważ podobnie jak opisane pasożyty, skłaniają swoich gospodarzy do zachowań szkodliwych dla nich samych (takich jak samobójcze ataki), lecz korzystnych dla pasożyta (na przykład dla islamu). Dawkins opisuje religie w podobny sposób – jako wirusy. Podobnie jak wirus przeziębienia każe swojemu nosicielowi kichać i w ten sposób się rozprzestrzenia, odnoszące sukcesy religie sprawiają, że ich nosiciele poświęcają cenne zasoby, aby szerzyć „infekcję”[563].",
